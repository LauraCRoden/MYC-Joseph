This project investigated Arabidopsis responses to Botrytis cinerea inoculation at two times of day in constant light. Detached leaves were inoculated with a spore suspension and lesions were measured.
Invesitgates the roles of MYC transcription factors in Arabidopsis circadian regulation of defences
Each excel file corresponds to a different experiment. Lesion sizes are recorded for each genotype at two times of day in LL
